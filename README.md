## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of statistical inference and hypothesis testing methods using Python. Through these methods, key relationships and differences between variables in the dataset are evaluated, providing insights into student academic performance, study habits, and extracurricular activities.

The project explores various hypotheses related to gender, career aspirations, study habits, and academic scores, aiming to uncover meaningful patterns and associations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about students, including attributes such as:
- **Math Score**  
- **History Score**  
- **Biology Score**  
- **Geography Score**  
- **Weekly Self-Study Hours**  
- **Absence Days**  
- **Gender**  
- **Career Aspirations**  
- **Participation in Extracurricular Activities**  
- **Part-Time Jobs**  

---

## Project Goals
1. Perform hypothesis testing for key research questions, such as:  
   - Gender differences in math scores and study hours.  
   - Impact of career aspirations on academic performance.  
   - Associations between extracurricular activities, study hours, and scores.  
   - Relationships between part-time jobs and academic performance.  
2. Use statistical tools to evaluate and choose between the null and alternative hypotheses.  
3. Provide clear justifications and interpretations for each hypothesis tested.

## Methodology
For each hypothesis:  
1. **Formulate Hypotheses**:  
   - Null Hypothesis (H₀): Represents no effect or relationship.  
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Represents an effect or relationship.  

2. **Perform Statistical Tests**:  
   - T-tests for comparing means.  
   - Chi-square tests for associations between categorical variables.  
   - Use p-values to determine statistical significance.  

3. **Decision Making**:  
   - Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on significance levels.  
   - Justify decisions with interpretations of the statistical results.

## Results
### Key Insights
1. Gender differences in math scores and weekly self-study hours were assessed, revealing significant patterns in study habits and academic performance.  
2. Career aspirations, particularly aiming to be a doctor, had a measurable impact on performance in specific subjects.  
3. Extracurricular activities were analyzed to explore their correlation with study hours and performance metrics.  
4. Associations between gender, part-time jobs, and career aspirations were evaluated, highlighting meaningful relationships in the dataset.

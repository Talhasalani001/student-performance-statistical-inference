    "Since the **p-value is much greater than 0.05**, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. This suggests that **there is no evidence to conclude that non-doctors have higher math scores than doctors**. In fact, the negative t-statistic suggests the opposite—that doctors may have higher math scores, though the difference is not statistically significant."

    "Chi-square statistic: A large Chi-square value (155.39) indicates a significant deviation from the assumption that gender and career aspiration are independent.\n",
    "p-value: The p-value is extremely small (6.72e-25), far below the significance level of 0.05. This means that the observed association between gender and career aspiration is statistically significant.\n",

    "Since the p-value is far less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is a significant association between gender and career aspiration based on the data. Gender and career aspirations are not independent of each other."
